                        .forEach() is used to run the same code on each element in an array, but does not change the
                        array
                        and returns undefined.

                        In the example below, we would use .forEach() to iterate through an array of foods and log that
                        we
                        would like to eat each one.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <code>
                            let food = ['mango','rice','pepper','pear'];
                            food.forEach(function(foodItem){ console.log('I want to eat '+foodItem);
                            });
                            
                        </code>

                        <span class="text-lg">.map():</span>
                        .map() executes the same code on each element in the array and returns a new array with the
                        updated
                        elements.

                        In the example below, we would use .map to iterate over the elements of the cost array and
                        divide
                        each element by 10, then assign our new array containing the new costs to the newCost variable.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <code>
                        let price = [100,400,300,700];
                        let newCost = cost.map(function(costItem){ return costItem / 10;
                        });
                        console.log(newCost);
                    </code>
                    </p>

                        <span class="text-lg">.filter():</span>

                        .filter() checks each element in the array to see if it meets certain criteria and returns a new
                        array with elements that return true for the criteria.

                        In the example below, we would use .filter to return values ​​that are less than 200.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <code>
                    let cost = [100,400,50,40,700];
                    let smallCost = cost.filter(function(costItem){ return costItem < 200
                    });
                    console.log(smallCost);
                    </code>
                    </p>
                    <p class="my-8">

                        <span class="text-lg"> .find():</span>
                        .find() Returns the first element of an array that meets a certain condition specified by
                        the function. If no element meets the condition, undefined is returned.
                        In the example below
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <code>
                             const foundElement = oldArray.find((element) => element === 5);

                <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl my-8">What is Event Loop?</h1>
                <p class="text-base">
                    The event loop is the secret to asynchronous JavaScript programming. JS performs all operations on a
                    single thread, but gives us the illusion of multithreading by using several smart data structures.
                    Let's take a look at what's happening on the back-end.

                    The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all operations in the queue to be performed.
                    Whenever a function completes, it is removed from the stack.

                    The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the
                    queue data structure to maintain the correct order in which all operations should be submitted for
                    execution.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    An example of this is the setTimeout method. When a setTimeout operation is processed on the stack,
                    it is sent to the corresponding API, which waits until the specified time to send the operation back
                    for processing.

                <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl my-8">How quizTimer function work?</h1>
                <p class="text-base">
                    This is the quizTimer function that sets the timer for the quiz. The function takes one argument
                    called dismiss which is used to stop the timer. If dismiss is true, then the clearInterval function
                    is called to stop the timer and the function returns. If the statement is incorrect, the timer
                    continues. Within the setInterval function, the code updates the HTML element by the id count to
                    display the current time in minutes and seconds. It does this by calculating the number of minutes
                    and seconds based on the count value, which is initially set to 0. The code also updates the element
                    class to toggle between text-red-300 and text-red-700 every other second if the timer has been
                    running longer than 60 seconds. Overall, this function can be used to display a timer for a quiz and
                    can be stopped by passing true to the dismiss parameter.
